This study was run as part of study 2 reported in "Two kinds of discussion and types of conversation." The Jupyter notebook used to generate the materials for that survey is [`conditional-variation/study-2/get_terms.ipynb`](https://github.com/sabjoslo/talking-politics/blob/master/experiments/conditional-variation/study-2/get_terms.ipynb). The raw participant data are also available in the folder `conditional-variation/study-2`. The 20 antonyms included as stimuli are included in the txt file `stimuli` in this folder. To replicate the analyses reported in the paper, run the notebook `replicate.ipynb` in this folder.
