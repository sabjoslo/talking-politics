All the materials needed to generate the surveys used in study 3 are available at https://osf.io/2knps/, including a full list of included stimuli [for the in-lab studies](https://osf.io/q7gjk/), and [for the MTurk studies](https://osf.io/94w3q/). In this folder is the raw participant data, as well as all the analysis code needed to replicate the analyses reported in the manuscript, as well as additional analyses pre-registered at https://osf.io/de935.

The list of stimuli used for the in-lab studies is also saved as `Plurals-survey_terms.csv`, while the list of stimuli used for the MTurk studies is saved as `stims_round2.csv`. The valence scores included in these lists are the mean ratings in the data collected and made available by [Warriner, A. B., Kuperman, V., & Brysbaert, M. (2013).
