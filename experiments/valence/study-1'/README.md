This study was run as part of study 1 reported in "Two kinds of discussion and types of conversation." The Jupyter notebook used to generate the materials for that survey is [`conditional-variation/study-1/get_terms.ipynb`](https://github.com/sabjoslo/talking-politics/blob/master/experiments/conditional-variation/study-1/get_terms.ipynb). [The full list of antonyms considered](https://github.com/sabjoslo/talking-politics/blob/master/experiments/conditional-variation/study-1/version_used_for_LoP_Ratings_2_antonyms_modified_with-pkls2.csv), as well as the raw participant data, are also available in the folder `conditional-variation/study-1`. The 20 antonyms included as stimuli are included in the txt file `stimuli` in this folder. To replicate the analyses reported in the paper, run the notebook `replicate.ipynb` in this folder.
